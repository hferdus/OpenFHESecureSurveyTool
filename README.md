This repository contains the files that we wrote for contructing a survey tool that utilizes Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to encrypt the data being sent from the client to the server. The client will collect data which will be sent to the server for aggegration. The server will not be able to read the data and can only perform computations with it. After the server has performed computations on the data, it will be sent back to the client for partial decryption, according to the system laid down by Threshold FHE scheme, an FHE scheme that allows for greater security and data privacy by having the client deal with both encryption and partial decryption. The server will only be in possession of encrypted data and the only processes it performs is computation and data aggegration. Our survey tool is designed to receive feedback from admitted students on how likely they are to accept their admission and study in Notre Dame.
